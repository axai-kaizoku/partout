# Partout

- [x] Deploy to vercel
- [x] Setup Auth
- [x] Copy frontend
- [x] Create Tables

Next Steps for Implementation
The form is now ready for:

- tRPC mutations to create parts with related data
- API endpoints for loading categories and vehicle data
- Image upload functionality with cloud storage
- Form validation before step progression
- Real-time model filtering based on selected make

The form structure now perfectly aligns with our e-commerce schema and provides a solid foundation for the full implementation.
